# HMS Enhancement Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

This document outlines the implementation of three new features for the Hospital Management System:

1. **Walk-in Appointment Flags**
2. **Payment Method Tracking** (Already existed, verified)
3. **Cancellation Reason Tracking**

---

## 1. Walk-in Appointment Flags

### Purpose
Differentiate between pre-scheduled appointments and emergency walk-in appointments for better tracking and analytics.

### Database Changes
**File:** `database_enhancements.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE Appointment 
ADD COLUMN is_walk_in BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE 
COMMENT 'TRUE if this is an emergency walk-in appointment';

CREATE INDEX idx_walk_in ON Appointment(is_walk_in);
```

### Backend Changes
**File:** `backend/server.js`

- **Line 308-326**: Updated `GET /api/appointments` query to support new fields
  - Query now returns all appointment data including `is_walk_in` flag
  - No additional logic needed as the field is automatically included

### Frontend Changes
**File:** `frontend/reception.js`

- **Lines 476-486**: Added walk-in checkbox to appointment form
  ```html
  <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" name="is_walk_in" 
         id="is-walk-in" value="1">
  <label>Emergency Walk-in</label>
  ```

- **Lines 289-292**: Updated appointments table to display walk-in badge
  - Shows yellow warning badge with exclamation icon for walk-in appointments
  - Badge appears next to appointment ID

### Usage
- **Receptionists** can check the "Emergency Walk-in" checkbox when creating/editing appointments
- Walk-in appointments are visually distinguished in the appointments list with a warning badge
- Can be used for reporting and analytics on walk-in vs scheduled appointments

---

## 2. Payment Method Tracking

### Status
✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** - Verified existing implementation

### Database
The `Payment` table already has the `method_of_payment` column.

### Backend
**File:** `backend/server.js`

- **Line 708**: Payment POST endpoint already accepts `method_of_payment` field
- **Line 716**: Field is inserted into database with payment record
- **Index added**: Line in `database_enhancements.sql` creates index for better query performance

### Database Enhancement
**File:** `database_enhancements.sql`

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_method ON Payment(method_of_payment);
```

### Usage
- Payment method is tracked when recording payments through invoices
- Supports values like: 'Cash', 'Card', 'Online', 'Insurance', etc.
- Already functional in the existing codebase

---

## 3. Cancellation Reason Tracking

### Purpose
Track detailed information when appointments are cancelled, including:
- Reason for cancellation
- Which staff member cancelled it
- When it was cancelled

### Database Changes
**File:** `database_enhancements.sql`

```sql
-- Add cancellation reason field
ALTER TABLE Appointment 
ADD COLUMN cancellation_reason VARCHAR(500) NULL 
COMMENT 'Reason for cancellation if status is Cancelled';

-- Track who cancelled
ALTER TABLE Appointment 
ADD COLUMN cancelled_by_staff_id INT NULL 
COMMENT 'Staff ID who cancelled the appointment';

-- Track when cancelled
ALTER TABLE Appointment 
ADD COLUMN cancelled_date DATETIME NULL 
COMMENT 'Date and time when appointment was cancelled';

-- Foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE Appointment 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_cancelled_by_staff 
FOREIGN KEY (cancelled_by_staff_id) REFERENCES Staff(staff_id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Index for queries
CREATE INDEX idx_cancelled ON Appointment(status, cancelled_date);
```

### Backend Changes
**File:** `backend/server.js`

#### 1. Updated GET Appointments Endpoint (Lines 308-326)
```javascript
SELECT a.*, 
       p.name as patient_name, 
       s.name as doctor_name, 
       b.name as branch_name,
       cancelled_staff.name as cancelled_by_name  // NEW
FROM Appointment a 
...
LEFT JOIN Staff cancelled_staff ON a.cancelled_by_staff_id = cancelled_staff.staff_id
```

#### 2. Enhanced PUT Appointments Endpoint (Lines 425-495)
Added special handling for cancellations:

```javascript
if (requestBody.status === 'Cancelled') {
    const [[staffMember]] = await connection.query(
        'SELECT staff_id FROM Staff WHERE user_id = ?', 
        [userId]
    );
    
    await connection.query(
        `UPDATE Appointment 
        SET status = 'Cancelled', 
            cancellation_reason = ?, 
            cancelled_by_staff_id = ?, 
            cancelled_date = NOW() 
        WHERE appointment_id = ?`,
        [requestBody.cancellation_reason || null, staffMember.staff_id, appointmentId]
    );
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatically captures the logged-in staff member's ID
- Records the current timestamp when cancelled
- Stores the cancellation reason from the form

### Frontend Changes
**File:** `frontend/reception.js`

#### 1. Added Cancellation Reason Field to Form (Lines 487-492)
```html
<div class="row" id="cancellation-reason-container" 
     style="display: ${appointment.status === 'Cancelled' ? 'block' : 'none'};">
    <div class="col-12 mb-3">
        <label class="form-label">Cancellation Reason</label>
        <textarea class="form-control" name="cancellation_reason" 
                  id="cancellation-reason" rows="3" 
                  placeholder="Enter reason for cancellation...">
            ${appointment.cancellation_reason || ''}
        </textarea>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### 2. Added Dynamic Show/Hide Logic (Lines 505-512)
```javascript
const statusSelect = document.getElementById("appointment-status");
const cancellationContainer = document.getElementById("cancellation-reason-container");

statusSelect.addEventListener("change", () => {
    if (statusSelect.value === "Cancelled") {
        cancellationContainer.style.display = "block";
    } else {
        cancellationContainer.style.display = "none";
    }
});
```

#### 3. Updated Appointments Table Display (Lines 296-299)
```javascript
<span class="badge bg-${statusColors[a.status]}">${a.status}</span>
${a.status === 'Cancelled' && a.cancellation_reason ? 
    `<br><small class="text-muted" 
               title="Cancelled by: ${a.cancelled_by_name || 'Unknown'}">
        Reason: ${a.cancellation_reason.substring(0, 50)}...
    </small>` 
: ''}
```

**Display Features:**
- Shows cancellation reason (truncated to 50 chars) below status badge
- Tooltip shows who cancelled the appointment
- Only visible for cancelled appointments

### Usage
1. **Cancelling an Appointment:**
   - Edit the appointment
   - Change status to "Cancelled"
   - Cancellation reason field appears automatically
   - Enter reason and save
   - System automatically records who cancelled and when

2. **Viewing Cancelled Appointments:**
   - Cancelled appointments show red "Cancelled" badge
   - Reason displayed below the badge
   - Hover over reason to see who cancelled it

## Database Schema Changes Summary

| Table | Column | Type | Purpose |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| Appointment | `is_walk_in` | BOOLEAN | Flag for emergency walk-ins |
| Appointment | `cancellation_reason` | VARCHAR(500) | Reason for cancellation |
| Appointment | `cancelled_by_staff_id` | INT | FK to Staff who cancelled |
| Appointment | `cancelled_date` | DATETIME | Timestamp of cancellation |
| Payment | `method_of_payment` | VARCHAR(50) | Payment method (existing) |

### Indexes Added
- `idx_walk_in` on `Appointment(is_walk_in)`
- `idx_cancelled` on `Appointment(status, cancelled_date)`
- `idx_payment_method` on `Payment(method_of_payment)`

---

## API Endpoints Modified

### GET /api/appointments
**Authorization:** Admin, Receptionist

**Response includes new fields:**
```json
{
  "appointment_id": 123,
  "is_walk_in": true,
  "cancellation_reason": "Patient requested reschedule",
  "cancelled_by_staff_id": 45,
  "cancelled_date": "2025-10-16 14:30:00",
  "cancelled_by_name": "Jane Doe"
}
```

### PUT /api/appointments/:id
**Authorization:** Admin, Receptionist

**New behavior for cancellations:**
- When `status = 'Cancelled'`, automatically captures:
  - `cancelled_by_staff_id` (from JWT token)
  - `cancelled_date` (NOW())
  - `cancellation_reason` (from request body)

**Request body example:**
```json
{
  "status": "Cancelled",
  "cancellation_reason": "Patient called to cancel due to emergency"
}
```
